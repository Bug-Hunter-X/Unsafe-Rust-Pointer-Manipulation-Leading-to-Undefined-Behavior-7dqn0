This repository demonstrates an example of undefined behavior in Rust using unsafe code. The `bug.rs` file contains code that modifies a vector through a raw pointer without proper safety measures. This can result in unexpected behavior or crashes. The `bugSolution.rs` file provides a safer alternative that avoids raw pointers and uses safer Rust constructs to achieve the same goal. This example highlights the importance of careful use of unsafe code in Rust to avoid undefined behavior and maintain program stability.
